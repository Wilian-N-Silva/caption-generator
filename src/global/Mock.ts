    lyrics: `We were made out of lightning
Sufferin' pain we should see by now
And we were burnt down like Catholics
On a winter road, never so cold

And I abandon my family
In a fit of rage, in a fit of want for you
Cause there's nothing else to do when you're confused
When you're confused

You coddle, and you're cat-like
I am scared
Your bald tongue, your right hand, your last piece
And I never really knew, who'd you see
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay

Now I, I keep it inside of me
Hoping you one day will let me go
It's the end, it's nothing I ended
So grab your arms, and dive into the night, into the night

I am not your savior
I'm just a friend keeping you alive
And eye sight proves that you're haunted
The same way that you speak all the time`,

    lyrics: `Love is a setting sun
Is a smoking gun
Is a 4 letter word
I hope it hurts
Love is a fatal flaw
Is a broken jaw
Is a burning bridge
Move your hips
And the ghost of the boulevard
Littered with lonely hearts
The city like a graveyard
Once was a postcard
When you lose your wonder
And you can't remember
When we were living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of...
Love was a dream to have
Was a kingsize bed
Was an escape plan
Was an open hand
Now it's a dog from hell
It's a dream you sell
It's an epitaph
It's photograph
And the ghost of the boulevard
Littered with lonely hearts
The city like a graveyard
Once was a postcard
When you lose your wonder
And you can't remember
When we were living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of...
Living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of...
(Days of thunder)
(Days of thunder)
(Days of thunder)`,
