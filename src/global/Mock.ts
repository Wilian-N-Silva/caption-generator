    lyrics: `We were made out of lightning
Sufferin' pain we should see by now
And we were burnt down like Catholics
On a winter road, never so cold

And I abandon my family
In a fit of rage, in a fit of want for you
Cause there's nothing else to do when you're confused
When you're confused

You coddle, and you're cat-like
I am scared
Your bald tongue, your right hand, your last piece
And I never really knew, who'd you see
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay

Now I, I keep it inside of me
Hoping you one day will let me go
It's the end, it's nothing I ended
So grab your arms, and dive into the night, into the night

I am not your savior
I'm just a friend keeping you alive
And eye sight proves that you're haunted
The same way that you speak all the time`,

    lyrics: `Love is a setting sun
Is a smoking gun
Is a 4 letter word
I hope it hurts
Love is a fatal flaw
Is a broken jaw
Is a burning bridge
Move your hips
And the ghost of the boulevard
Littered with lonely hearts
The city like a graveyard
Once was a postcard
When you lose your wonder
And you can't remember
When we were living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of...
Love was a dream to have
Was a kingsize bed
Was an escape plan
Was an open hand
Now it's a dog from hell
It's a dream you sell
It's an epitaph
It's photograph
And the ghost of the boulevard
Littered with lonely hearts
The city like a graveyard
Once was a postcard
When you lose your wonder
And you can't remember
When we were living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of...
Living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of thunder
Living in the days of...
(Days of thunder)
(Days of thunder)
(Days of thunder)`,

    lyrics: `Molten bloody earth
A focused open wound
All highways lead right here
Ghost

Storms and heavy air
Riots in the street
Iâ€™ll take you somewhere safe
Ghost

Will we feel the same
Caught between the sheets
Time is time again
Ghost

Just show me your world
Will we feel the same

Dancing around my head
Glowing stems of death
Time is time again
Ghost

Anodyne you hurt like heaven
Physical comfort drift away
Anodyne you move like heaven
Physical comfort drift away
Anodyne distortion has brought us back together
Operation Overlife guide us away`,

    lyrics: `Day-trader in a tie-dyed jumpsuit
And a gutter punk kid with a neck tattoo
They're hookin' up at the unisex bathroom
It was Brooklyn, it was Friday, it was love
Across the bar sat the hip-hop purist
Arguing with the jazz obscurists
And in the corner were the terrified tourists
Brooklyn, Friday, love

Angel choirs on the corner all night
Sing Johnny Cash and Jackson 5
A little heaven you can stumble into
We got your invite tonight

Don't try to fight it
Oh, it's just Brooklyn on a Friday
Don't try to fight it
Oh, it's just Brooklyn on a Friday

They come from Mississippie and La La Land
New-wave hippies and the pop-goth glam
It's just 'cause parents don't understand
It was Brooklyn, it was Friday, it was love
From this roof, you can see the stars
We are the left bank dreamers and the avant-garde
I'll sing my borrowed song on your borrowed guitar
It was Brooklyn, it was Friday, it was love

Angel choirs on the midnight G train
Some Beastie Boys and Kurt Cobain
A revolution you can learn to dance to
With a friendly face on the way

Don't try to fight it
Oh, it's just Brooklyn on a Friday
Don't try to fight it
Oh, it's just Brooklyn on a Friday

Bushwick Avenue
Bedford Avenue
Franklin Avenue
I'm on my way, where are you?

Don't try to fight it
Oh, it's just Brooklyn on a Friday
Don't try to fight it
Oh, it's just Brooklyn on a Friday
Don't try to fight it
Oh, it's just Brooklyn on a Friday
Don't try to fight it
Oh, it's just Brooklyn on a Friday

It's just Brooklyn on a Friday
It's just Brooklyn on a Friday
Bushwick Avenue
It's just Brooklyn on a Friday
Bedford Avenue
It's just Brooklyn on a Friday
Franklin Avenue
It's just Brooklyn on a Friday
I'm on my way (where are you?)
It's just Brooklyn on a Friday (ooh, ooh)`,
